# HR-Analytics-Dashboard
The goal of this project is to help organizations improve employee performance and retention by providing insights through the dashboard.

Here's a summary of the steps I followed to create the dashboard :

1. Data Extraction: I received the data from the client in Excel format.
2. Data Transformation: I loaded the data into Power BI and cleaned it by removing any empty or duplicate values, correcting spelling errors, and ensuring the correct data types using Power Query.
3. Data Loading: The transformed data was loaded into Power View for further analysis.
4. Data Modeling: I created a logical structure for the data through data modeling, which allows for effective analysis and visualization.
5. DAX Formulas: I used the Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) language to create calculated measures and columns.
6. Report Building: I built the dashboard by creating user-friendly reports and visualizations that provide intuitive insights.

Here are some key insights from the HR Analytics Dashboard :

a) Most employees who leave the company are between the ages of 26 and 35.
b) The job roles that see the most employees leaving are in the fields of Life Sciences Education and Laboratory Technician.
c) Employees who have been with the company for 1 to 2 years are more likely to leave compared to others.
d) Even though the average salary is 6.5k, employees who earn less than that are more likely to leave the company.
